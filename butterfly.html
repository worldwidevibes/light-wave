As I Sit Here In This Broken Down State Of Mind, 
<br>
Broken Because Of The Love Of A Lost One 
<br>
I Think Of Why I Am Broken Down , What Were The Thoughts Of This Lost One ? 
<br>
He Was 6’2 , With The Eyes Of A Smooth Operator 
<br>
Words  So Smooth , He Could Make You Change Your Mind , A Manipultive Type Of Persuader 
<br>
Why Did I Let You Feed Me Thorns , But Thanked You For Roses 
<br>
Why Did I Let You Lead ,
When Our Road Wasn't Chosen
<br>
Why Did I Always Stay & Believe In All Of Your Damn Lies 
<br>
Probably Because I'm A Lost One 
<br>
Who found A Cool Vibe.

"A LETTER TO LOVE"
<div class="type">

<div class="pricing-footer">
Don't mean to spite you 
<br>
Might turn around and fight you 
<br>
See love now I despise you because I found myself to be just like you  
<br>
Good for the mind and bad for the soul, 
Love do you know how many stories have been told 
<br>
About you?
<br>
Dear love I hate you 
<br>
And I know you feel same
<br>
Damn love 
<br>
Don't think I'll ever forgive you
<br> 
When I die and come back I hope I never relive you
<br>
How dare you intrude on me 
<br>
Haven't done much to you yet you're so rude to me 
<br>
Ain't you supposed to be the pain reliever?
<br>
Yet causing pain is all you do to me
<br>
Dear love you're a sin
<br>
Not sure who's worse between you and him 
<br>
But in hindsight you two are one of the same 
<br>
Both the makers of your own twisted game
<br>
And I don't mean to say your name in vain 
<br>
But I'm here now and you're the one to blame 
<br>
Only one part of me that's untouched by you is my mind 
<br>
So don't destroy that piece of mine
<br>
Dear love I wish I would've never met you
Sincerely, the one you should've left behind

"COLORS"
<div class="type">
Jade The Poet
</div>
People are all beautiful no matter the color
<br>
Your mother, your teacher, your father, your brother
<br>
Albino is beauty 
<br>
Skin as dark as the sky on a night in the suburbs 
<br>
Skin brown as melted chocolate on a s'more 
<br>
Skin with different pigments 
<br>
These people embody the beauty and grace of those who are not the face on the cover of the magazines 
<br>
Though they are kings and queens 
<br>
the people who fail to see this are the media and the people who run it
<br>
the government 
The source of all hell in America
<br> 
The father of hate and the lighter of torture
<br>
Mixed race people?
<br>
They truly do exist but not everyone knows or understand why people must inter breed with a skin color or ethnicity different from themselves
<br> 
We are Human, We are valid, We don't need to prove ourselves to be a part of your race 
<br>
We aren't your fetishes
<br>
You stare at me in disgrace 
<br>
While looking at my mother's brown face 
<br>
I feel somewhat displaced 
<br>
Maybe I'm not a part of this race? 
<br>
Where do I belong in this database in the desktop of life
<br>
How can I identify myself if I'm , “ Basically white”?
<br>
To be exact I'm Puerto Rican, Jamaican, Irish, Scottish, Cuban, Italian, Taino Indian,and Black
<br>
How do I proudly represent myself when my own race is not represented in a questionnaire
<br>
Sometimes I wonder why the worlds so unfair
<br>
Does my fair skin determine the race that I bare?
<br>
Colors are so complicated you never know what they represent
<br>
If you misinterpret someone's identity you may just leave a dent.

Voices... 
<br>
All these voices telling me I'm weird
<br>
Always been criticized for how I dress
<br>
Not the regular person 'cause I don't wear Jay's 
<br>
I'd rather wear some vans or converse 
<br>
I'm weird because I don't wanna pop off on the first girl that talks crazy 
<br>
Nah, I'd rather keep my cool instead of losing myself
<br>
Abnormal because I don't wanna make friends with the first person that smiles in my face 
<br>
Labeled damaged because I have major trust issues 
<br>
A mystery because I'd rather observe than to run my mouth 
<br>
Not the most liked person because everybody thinks I'm stuck-up 
<br>
I'm not stuck-up, I'm just fed up with the nonsense 
<br>
Just the other day somebody told me I talk white and professional 
<br>
Ummm.....like what does that even mean
<br>
You think I'm abstract because I don't like to leave my house 
<br>
It's true, I'm a homebody 
<br>
I think it's crazy how you think I'm weird 
<br>
Listen man, I just do me in life like I was taught

"TESTIMONY OF A POET"
<div class="type">
Jay Nashay
</div>
<div class="pricing-footer">
oh child how you get so lyrical, a miracle , truly a flowerchild individual ? 
<br>
your words hold so much weight when you speak , how you get so deep ? 
<br>
well it's ain't that hard when your drowning , I choose to write anytime I'm frowning. 
<br>
when my happiness is going through a recession, 
depression is catching up to me. 
<br>
but I won't let it be.
so I write my pain to gain passion , I'm not perfect . 
<br>
I always have to remind myself that I'm whole , not a fraction. 
<br>
I'm just caught in between "who I want to be" , "how people see me" & " who I really am " . 
<br>
& I rather not give a damn , but I do. 
<br>
and as much as you deny it so do you .
<br>
what new ? matter of fact what's more true ? 
<br>
but when I write nobody can tell me nothing , & I'm not listening if you trying to tell me something. 
<br>
too busy getting high off a vibe , I'm on a different type of time. 
<br>
I'm jumping off a building , ain't looking for nobody to catch me. 
<br>
I'm getting reckless , no chains or containment & gunning at anyone trying to kill my freedom , willingly & aiming. 
<br>
because I put too much truth to waste when I write , this done got me through many too nights when I rather not see the sun . 
<br>
this ain't fun , this is therapy. 
<br>
but I don't think y'all hearing me ?! 
<br>
& then they ask me .. 
oh child how you get so lyrical, a miracle , truly a flowerchild individual ? 
<br>
your words hold so much weight when you speak , how you get so deep ? 
<br>
... & honestly , I don't know. I just keep the words rhyming & I got a nice flow.

You are the spark that initiates the fire 
<br>
You are the type of rare that makes me want to think harder 
<br>
Think harder go farther 
<br>
Makes me start to breath harder
<br>
The type of rare that just makes me wonder 
<br>
Wonder about you 
<br>
wonder about me  
<br>
wonder  who you came to be
<br> 
Wonder  what you think I see 
<br>
Wonder  what you see in me 
<br>
You are the type of rare that is one in a trillion 
<br>
The one who hates the super hero, instead the villain 
<br>
Like the one of a few that knows not every black person is stealing
<br> 
The one who's lucky enough to turn their fantasy life real and 
<br>
You are the type of rare that's like Deja vu 
<br>
Like the only boy you loved that said I love you too
<br>
Like the one friend you find that you know you'll never lose
<br>
Being honest You're as rare as some custom made shoes 
<br>
You are the type that's so beautifully rare
<br> 
So Beautifully rare as unique as curly hair  
<br>
So beautifully rare You Make my lungs have no air 
<br>
No air is so rare and I think it's unfair how it makes me so scared cause you take it without care 
<br>
You are as rare as my first time feeling butterflies 
<br>
As rare as this moment because I know how time flys 
<br>
As rare as life itself  because let's face it we all will die 
<br>
As rare as the first time my eyes met this guys that I use to love but now despise cause hearing his name 
<br>
reminds me of lies 
<br>
And as rare as having all ears in a crowd with all stare when public speaking is your fear but you're feeling endeared  
<br>
And I know I'd sound crazy if I said your like love at first sight 
<br>
Because I know that love isn't only what meets the eye 
<br>
But sometimes one look could make your temperature rise 
<br>
Temperature rise, make your throat feel dry, wanna scream and cry cause you feel alive 
<br>
You're as rare it can get 
<br>
So don't focus on the rest 
<br>
Who cluelessly ignorant 
<br>
To all the beauty that connects
<br>
For you are uniquely, beautifully, unapologetically rare
